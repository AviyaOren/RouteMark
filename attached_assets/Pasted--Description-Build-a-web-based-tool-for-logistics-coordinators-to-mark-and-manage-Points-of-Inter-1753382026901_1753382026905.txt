üß≠ Description:
Build a web-based tool for logistics coordinators to mark and manage Points of Interest (POIs) relevant to field riders. These POIs include essential locations such as restrooms, water fountains, food stops, and rest areas. The tool allows users to create, edit, and delete POIs on an interactive map, with data stored in JSON format to be consumed later by a mobile rider app. The platform will also include user management features such as login and permission-based access control.
